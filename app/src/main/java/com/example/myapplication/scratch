To implement:
-Inventory system:
1.Needs to keep track of weapons/equipment

-Weapon system:
1.Player can swap weapons
2.Weapons will need to be able to have unique properties

-Class System:
1.Each class comes with its own properties/abilities/combat style

To explore:

-An activity that allows you to start a timer for X minutes, during that time get as many steps as you can
OR get to a target, IE: 1000 steps in 5 mins(like going on a run/walk) Gives rewards. Would have to be limited in attempts.

-Learning skills like FFT- gain exp in job ur using or learn them from weapons? players can equip X points worth of skills?

-enemies will charge as they attack, filling a progress bar, each one having a unique attack (with effects?) on full charge.

-Does combat need stamina usage?
