Combat flow

Select attacks, uses stamina per card, regen X per turn

EXAMPLE

I select slash(speed 2, stamina 2)

Enemies lock in their attacks

Turn order decided by speed.

One by one each attack is resolved in order of lowest speed to highest

So in this turn, the player would attack once

When the player attacks, each ability will have a window of timing, a flash where a new input can be made. If timed right, the player can
use whichever ability they chose, as long as they can afford the stamina cost

If the player inputs nothing, it does normal damage,
if they hit the timing it does increased
but if they attempt and miss it decreases.

Towerclimb mode, start recording for X minutes, get as many steps as you can.

Like knighthood, enemies will charge as they attack, each one ahving a unique attack on full charge.

Players will too
