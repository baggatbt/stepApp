Combat flow

Select attacks, uses stamina per card, regen X per turn

EXAMPLE

I select slash(speed 2, stamina 2)

Enemies lock in their attacks

Turn order decided by speed.

One by one each attack is resolved in order of lowest speed to highest

So in this turn, the player would attack once

When the player attacks, each ability will have a window of timing, a flash where a new input can be made. If timed right, the player can
use whichever ability they chose, as long as they can afford the stamina cost

If the player inputs nothing, it does normal damage,
if they hit the timing it does increased
but if they attempt and miss it decreases.

Towerclimb mode, start recording for X minutes, get as many steps as you can.

Like knighthood, enemies will charge as they attack, each one ahving a unique attack on full charge.

Players will too


hen the enemy uses the special, the player animation still happens first, but takes damage first.

The battle also doesnt end until hitting them again after using special.

Battle is passed (enemies,player)
Battle starts
Shows enemy turn order, waits for player input
once the move is in, player is inserted into turn order
After a small delay, the attacks start launching low to high
once every move is used, order resets, enemies adjust and player is prompted to choose another move. combat repeats.






Keep skills and status effects decoupled.

Subclass Player and Enemy (Allows them to derive from the same parent class)
