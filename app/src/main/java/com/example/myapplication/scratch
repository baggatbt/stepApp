Combat flow

Select attacks, uses stamina per card, regen X per turn

EXAMPLE

I select slash(speed 2, stamina 2)

Enemies lock in their attacks

Turn order decided by speed.

One by one each attack is resolved in order of lowest speed to highest

So in this turn, the player would attack once, and block once

When the player attacks, each ability will have a window of timing, a flash where a new input can be made. If timed right, the player can
use whichever ability they chose, as long as they can afford the stamina cost


TODO:
10 unit progress bar, make 10 enemy icons not visible. turn order function will take enemy speed (1-10) and make visible the corresponding icons.
